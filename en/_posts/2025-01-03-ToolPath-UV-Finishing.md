# Description

* 2nd Milling Stage Cutting Toolpath Component: Outputs values that divide curves parallel between curves of different lengths in the direction of the Cutting Direction, as shown in the figure below.

# Input

* **Brep**: Input a Brep or Surface UV object.
* **Reference Plane**: Input the reference plane for Target Orientation when Tilting weight = 0.

## Built-in Param | UVFinishing

* **Cutting Direction [Boolean]**: Select the direction ‚Äì U (False) / V (True).
* **Stepover**: Determines the amount of material removed in the horizontal direction. The default value is less than or equal to half the end mill diameter, allowing for finer finishing. (Stepover <= End Mill Diameter * 1/2)
* **Tilting Weight**: Weight for Target Tilting, accepts values between 0.0 and 1.0. Closer to 0 means the Target Plane aligns with the normal of the Base Plane; closer to 1 means it aligns with the normal of the Surface.
* **Tolerance**: Toolpath resolution.

# Output

* **Curve**: Outputs the curves of the finishing layer.
* **Target Plane**: Outputs the indices of planes as a DataTree.
